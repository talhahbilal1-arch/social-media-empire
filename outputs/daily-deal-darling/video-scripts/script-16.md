## Script

If you struggle to fall asleep or wake up feeling exhausted, [PAUSE] try the 3-2-1 method tonight.

[VISUAL: Person tossing and turning in bed]

It's so simple, and it completely transformed how I sleep.

Here's how it works:

[VISUAL: Number 3 graphic with clock showing 3 hours before bed]
Three hours before bed: Stop eating. [PAUSE] Give your body time to digest so it's not working overtime while you're trying to sleep.

[VISUAL: Kitchen closed for the night]

[VISUAL: Number 2 graphic with clock showing 2 hours before bed]
Two hours before bed: Stop working. Close the laptop. No more emails or chores. Your brain needs time to wind down.

[VISUAL: Laptop closing, relaxing activity instead]

[VISUAL: Number 1 graphic with clock showing 1 hour before bed]
One hour before bed: Stop screens. [PAUSE] That means phone, TV, all of it. The blue light tricks your brain into thinking it's daytime.

[VISUAL: Phone being put away, book being picked up]

Replace that hour with reading, stretching, or just sitting in dim light.

You'll be amazed at how much faster you fall asleep - and how much better you feel in the morning.
