## Script

Here's how to figure out which clothes you actually wear - [PAUSE] and which ones are just taking up space.

[VISUAL: Full, cluttered closet]

It's called the hanger flip trick, and it takes 30 seconds to set up.

At the start of the month, flip all your hangers so they're facing backward. Like this.

Now, every time you wear something and hang it back up, flip the hanger the right way.

At the end of the month - or two months if you want more data - [PAUSE] look at what's still backward.

Those are the clothes you never reached for. And now you know what you can donate without guilt.

It's not about getting rid of everything. It's about keeping what you actually love and use. [PAUSE]

Try it this month!
