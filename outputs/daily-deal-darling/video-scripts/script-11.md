## Script

Okay, be honest. [PAUSE] How much water have you had today?

[VISUAL: Nearly empty water bottle]

If you're like most of us, probably not enough. But I have some sneaky tricks that helped me finally drink enough water without constantly reminding myself.

[VISUAL: Full water bottle]

First: Get a water bottle you actually like. [PAUSE] Sounds silly, but if it's cute or has a straw, you'll drink from it more.

[VISUAL: Attractive water bottles]

Second: Put a glass of water in every room you spend time in. Kitchen, desk, nightstand.

[VISUAL: Water glasses in different rooms]

Third: Drink a full glass before every meal. It's an easy habit to attach to something you already do.

[VISUAL: Drinking water before eating]

Fourth: Add flavor if plain water bores you. [PAUSE] Lemon, cucumber, berries - whatever makes you reach for it.

[VISUAL: Fruit-infused water]

These tiny changes add up. Before you know it, you're hydrated without even thinking about it!
