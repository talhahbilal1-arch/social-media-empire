## Script

Hey there, lovely! [PAUSE] Can I tell you about the game-changer that finally helped me tackle my messy house?

[VISUAL: Show cluttered counter or drawer]

It's called the 5-Minute Declutter Method, and it's so simple. [PAUSE]

Here's how it works: Set a timer for just 5 minutes. Pick ONE small area - a junk drawer, your nightstand, or that corner of the counter that collects everything.

[VISUAL: Timer on phone, then hands organizing items]

Now here's the magic: You only make three decisions. [PAUSE] Keep it, toss it, or donate it. No overthinking allowed!

[VISUAL: Three bins or piles labeled]

When the timer goes off, you stop. That's it! [PAUSE]

Do this once a day, and within a week, you'll be amazed at the difference.

[VISUAL: Before and after comparison]

The best part? Anyone can find 5 minutes. Even on your busiest day.
