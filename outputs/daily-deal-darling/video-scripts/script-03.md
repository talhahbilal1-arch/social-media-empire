## Script

Can I be honest with you? [PAUSE] I used to spend my entire Saturday cleaning, and I was exhausted AND resentful.

Then I discovered zone cleaning, and it completely transformed my weekends.

Here's the concept: Instead of cleaning your whole house at once, you divide it into zones. [PAUSE]

[VISUAL: Simple house diagram with colored zones]

Monday is the kitchen. Tuesday is bathrooms. Wednesday is bedrooms. [PAUSE] You get the idea.

Each day, you spend just 15 to 20 minutes deep cleaning that one zone.

By the end of the week, your whole house is clean - but you never spent more than 20 minutes a day doing it!

No more marathon cleaning sessions. [PAUSE] No more guilt. Just a consistently tidy home.
