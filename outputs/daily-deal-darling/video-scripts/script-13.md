## Script

Have you ever wondered why your perfume seems to disappear an hour after you put it on? [PAUSE]

Here's what nobody tells you: It's not the perfume. It's how you're applying it.

Let me show you three tricks that make any fragrance last all day.

[VISUAL: Tip #1 graphic]
First: Apply to moisturized skin. [PAUSE] Dry skin doesn't hold scent. Put on unscented lotion first, then your perfume.

Second: Hit your pulse points - wrists, neck, behind the ears, and here's a secret one - behind your knees!

Third: Don't rub your wrists together. [PAUSE] I know we all do it, but it actually breaks down the fragrance.

Just spray, let it dry, and walk out the door smelling amazing all day long.
