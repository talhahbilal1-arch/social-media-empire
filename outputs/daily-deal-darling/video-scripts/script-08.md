## Script

Here's a tiny change that made my kitchen look so much cleaner: [PAUSE]

[VISUAL: Cluttered kitchen counter]

I made a rule. Only five things live on my counters. That's it. Five.

[VISUAL: Clean, minimal counter]

For me, it's the coffee maker, a cutting board, a pretty jar with utensils, a fruit bowl, and one plant.

[VISUAL: Each item shown as mentioned]

Everything else? It found a home in a cabinet or drawer. [PAUSE]

[VISUAL: Items being stored away]

I know what you're thinking - but I use those things every day! Here's the thing: It takes 3 seconds to pull something out of a cabinet.

[VISUAL: Hand easily grabbing item from cabinet]

But that visual clutter? It adds mental weight you don't even realize you're carrying.

Try it for one week. [PAUSE] Pick your five things and put everything else away.

Your kitchen will feel twice as big, I promise.
