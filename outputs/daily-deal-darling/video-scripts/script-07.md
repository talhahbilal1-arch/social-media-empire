## Script

Can we talk about something? [PAUSE] Somewhere along the way, self-care became this expensive thing that requires fancy products and spa memberships.

[VISUAL: Expensive spa products, price tags]

But real self-care? It doesn't have to cost a thing.

Here are five completely free ways to take care of yourself:

[VISUAL: Number graphics with corresponding scenes]

One: Take a walk outside without your phone. [PAUSE] Just notice the sky and breathe.

[VISUAL: Woman walking outdoors, peaceful]

Two: Call someone you love just to say hi. Connection is self-care.

[VISUAL: Smiling during phone call]

Three: Take the longest shower you want - and use the good towel.

[VISUAL: Luxurious shower moment]

Four: Say no to something you don't want to do. [PAUSE] Boundaries are self-care too.

[VISUAL: Woman looking relieved, at peace]

Five: Go to bed 30 minutes early with a book instead of your phone.

[VISUAL: Cozy reading in bed]

None of this costs money. All of it fills your cup.
