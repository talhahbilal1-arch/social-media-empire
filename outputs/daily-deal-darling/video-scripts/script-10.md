## Script

Raise your hand if you've ever ordered takeout because you were just too tired to figure out dinner. [PAUSE]

Same, friend. Same.

But here's a simple meal prep hack that's saved me countless times - and it only takes about 30 minutes on Sunday.

I call it "Prep, Don't Cook."

Instead of making full meals, I just prep the ingredients. [PAUSE]

[VISUAL: Vegetables being chopped]

I wash and chop all my vegetables for the week. I cook a batch of grains - rice, quinoa, whatever you like.

I prep two proteins - maybe bake some chicken and cook some ground turkey.

Then I store everything separately. [PAUSE]

Now when dinner time comes, I just grab and combine. Stir fry takes 10 minutes. A grain bowl takes 5.

No recipes required. Just mix and match what sounds good!
