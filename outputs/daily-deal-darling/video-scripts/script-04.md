## Script

Here's a secret nobody talks about: [PAUSE] You don't need a fancy 17-step morning routine to have a great day.

I tried all those elaborate routines, and honestly? They stressed me out more than they helped.

So now I do just three things every single morning. [PAUSE]

[VISUAL: Number 1 graphic]
First: I drink a full glass of water before anything else. It wakes up your whole body.

[VISUAL: Pouring water, drinking]

[VISUAL: Number 2 graphic]
Second: I take three deep breaths. Just three. [PAUSE] It centers me for the day.

[VISUAL: Number 3 graphic]
Third: I write down one thing I'm grateful for. Takes 30 seconds.

[VISUAL: Hand writing in journal]

That's it! Water, breath, gratitude. [PAUSE] Under 5 minutes, and it sets the whole tone for your day.
