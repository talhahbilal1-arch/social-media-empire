## Script

You don't need to spend hundreds of dollars to have a Pinterest-worthy pantry. [PAUSE]

[VISUAL: Beautiful organized pantry]

Here's how I organized mine for under 30 dollars - and it's stayed organized for months.

[VISUAL: Before shot - messy pantry]

First tip: Use what you already have. [PAUSE] Mason jars, old containers, even shoeboxes work great for grouping items.

Second: Dollar store bins are your best friend. I got these clear bins for a dollar each, and they're perfect for snacks, packets, and small items.

Third: Labels make everything look intentional. [PAUSE] You can print them for free online or just use masking tape and a marker.

[VISUAL: Simple labels being applied]

Fourth: Group similar items together. All the baking stuff in one area. All the snacks together. All the canned goods in one spot.

The key isn't fancy products - it's having a system that makes sense for YOUR life.
