## Script

Okay, I need you to hear this: [PAUSE] Self-care doesn't require a spa day or three hours of free time.

[VISUAL: Busy mom or working woman looking tired]

Some days, all you have is 10 minutes. And that's enough.

Here's my 10-minute reset that never fails:

[VISUAL: Bathroom or cozy corner]

First 3 minutes: Wash your face with warm water. Really feel the water. Be present. [PAUSE]

[VISUAL: Face washing, relaxed expression]

Next 3 minutes: Apply your favorite moisturizer or serum slowly. Give yourself a little face massage.

[VISUAL: Skincare application with gentle massage]

Last 4 minutes: Sit somewhere quiet. Close your eyes. Just breathe. [PAUSE]

[VISUAL: Woman sitting peacefully, eyes closed]

No phone. No to-do list. Just you.

That's it. 10 minutes, and you'll feel like a different person. [PAUSE]

You deserve these 10 minutes. I promise.
