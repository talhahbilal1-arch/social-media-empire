## Script

Okay, real talk. [PAUSE] How many times have you organized a space only to have it look like a disaster again two weeks later?

[VISUAL: Messy closet or overstuffed cabinet]

I was SO frustrated until I learned this simple rule that changed everything.

It's called One-In-One-Out. [PAUSE]

Every time something new comes into your home - whether it's a cute top, a kitchen gadget, or even a throw pillow - something similar has to leave.

[VISUAL: Hands bringing in new item, then removing old item]

New coffee mug? Donate one you don't love. [PAUSE] New pair of shoes? Time to let go of those worn-out ones.

[VISUAL: Donation box being filled]

This tiny habit keeps the clutter from ever piling up again. [PAUSE]

It's not about having less - it's about making room for what you actually love.
