## Script

What if I told you that having fewer clothes could mean more outfit options? [PAUSE]

[VISUAL: Overflowing messy closet vs. minimal organized closet]

That's the magic of a capsule wardrobe, and you don't need to buy anything new to start one.

Here's how it works: You pick about 30 to 40 pieces that all work together. [PAUSE] Every top goes with most bottoms. Every piece can be dressed up or down.

Start by looking at what you already have and pulling out your neutrals - black, white, gray, navy, tan.

These are your foundation. Add in three or four colors you love and always feel good in.

Now look at those pieces. Do they mix and match? [PAUSE] If something only goes with one other item, it might not earn its spot.

The goal is pieces that work hard for you - not a closet full of "I have nothing to wear."

Getting dressed becomes so much faster and easier.
