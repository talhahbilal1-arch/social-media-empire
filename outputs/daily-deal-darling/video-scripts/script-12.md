## Script

If you wake up with puffy eyes like I do, [PAUSE] I have a trick that works in under two minutes.

[VISUAL: Woman looking tired with puffy eyes]

No fancy tools needed. Just ice cubes and a spoon.

Here's what you do: Put a metal spoon in a glass of ice water for about 30 seconds. While you're waiting, splash your face with cold water.

Then take that cold spoon and gently press it under your eyes. [PAUSE] Start from the inner corner and move outward.

Do each eye for about 30 seconds.

The cold constricts blood vessels and reduces that puffiness almost instantly.

I do this every morning before makeup, and it makes such a difference. [PAUSE]

Works even better if you keep the spoon in your freezer overnight!
