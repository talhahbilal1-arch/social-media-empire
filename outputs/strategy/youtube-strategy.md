### Final Recommendation: FITNESS (Fit Over 35)

#### Primary Reasons:

1. **Highest Overall Potential**: Combines strong search volume, excellent monetization, and unlimited content sustainability.

2. **Faceless Format Advantage**: While fitness seems face-dependent, faceless fitness content works extremely well:
   - Point-of-view (POV) workout videos
   - Animated exercise demonstrations
   - Stock footage compilations with voiceover
   - Screen recordings of workout timers/routines
   - Text-based motivation and tips content

3. **Multiple Revenue Streams**:
   - Ad revenue (high CPMs)
   - Affiliate marketing (equipment, supplements)
   - Digital products (workout programs)
   - Membership/Patreon for exclusive content

4. **Demographic Alignment**: The 35+ fitness audience aligns with existing brands (Menopause Planner audience) allowing cross-promotion.

5. **Content Repurposing**: Fitness content easily repurposes to YouTube Shorts, TikTok, Instagram Reels, and Pinterest.

#### Secondary Recommendation: Menopause/Women's Health

Consider this as a secondary channel or integrated content strategy:
- Lower competition means faster authority building
- Highest CPMs in the analysis
- Natural overlap with Fit Over 35 audience
- Could be a content pillar within fitness channel

#### Not Recommended for Primary Focus: Deals/Lifestyle

While profitable short-term, the content sustainability challenges and constant research requirements make this less suitable for a scalable, automated content system.
