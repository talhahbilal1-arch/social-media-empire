## Pricing Strategy

### Cost Calculation Formula

```
Total Cost = Base Product Cost + Shipping to Customer + Platform Fees + Marketing Cost

Minimum Price = Total Cost / (1 - Desired Profit Margin)

Example:
- T-shirt base: $10
- Average shipping: $4
- Platform fee (Etsy 6.5%): ~$2
- Marketing allocation: $2
- Total cost: $18

For 40% margin: $18 / (1 - 0.40) = $30 retail price
```
