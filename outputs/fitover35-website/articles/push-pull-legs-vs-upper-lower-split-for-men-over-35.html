<h1>Push Pull Legs vs Upper Lower Split: Which Works Better After 35?</h1>
<p>I switched from a Push Pull Legs split to Upper/Lower at 36, and my recovery improved within two weeks. That surprised me because I'd been running PPL for years and assumed it was the "optimal" split everyone claimed it was.</p>
<p>Here's the thing: both splits work. But when you're over 35, recovery becomes the limiting factor, not your ability to push hard in the gym. I'm going to break down both approaches, tell you what actually changed for me, and help you figure out which one fits your life right now.</p>
<h2>What Each Split Actually Looks Like</h2>
<p><strong>Push Pull Legs (PPL):</strong> You're hitting the gym 6 days a week, or 3 days if you run it once through. Push day covers chest, shoulders, and triceps. Pull day is back and biceps. Legs are, well, legs. Each muscle group gets hit twice per week if you run through the rotation twice.</p>
<p><strong>Upper/Lower Split:</strong> Four days per week. Two upper body days (everything from the waist up), two lower body days. You're training each muscle group twice weekly with three full rest days built in.</p>
<p>The frequency is similar for muscle stimulation, but the weekly structure is completely different. That matters more than you'd think when you're juggling a career, family, and the reality that you can't bounce back like you did at 25.</p>
<p>I use a <div style="border:1px solid #e5e7eb;border-radius:12px;padding:16px;margin:16px 0;display:flex;gap:16px;align-items:center;background:#fafafa;"><div><strong style="display:block;margin-bottom:8px;font-size:1em;color:#111;">foam roller</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=foam+roller&tag=dailydealdarl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored" style="display:inline-block;background:#FF9900;color:#111;padding:7px 18px;border-radius:6px;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;font-size:0.88em;">Check Price on Amazon →</a></div></div> before every upper body session now—it's become non-negotiable for keeping my shoulders healthy. Five minutes of rolling out my lats and thoracic spine prevents that tight, cranky feeling I used to get on back-to-back training days.</p>
<h2>Why PPL Gets Harder After 35</h2>
<p>I loved PPL in my early 30s. Six days in the gym felt productive. I was making gains, feeling strong, and the split made sense: specialize each day, keep sessions under an hour, move on.</p>
<p>Then I hit 36, and something shifted. I'd finish a pull day, feel great, then wake up the next morning with my lower back tight. Not injured—just not fully recovered. By the time leg day rolled around, I'd be dragging. The fourth or fifth consecutive training day started feeling like a grind instead of momentum.</p>
<p>The problem isn't the split itself. PPL works great for muscle building after 35 if your recovery can keep up. But six consecutive training days means you're managing cumulative fatigue differently than when you were younger. One subpar night of sleep, a stressful work week, or fighting off a cold—suddenly you're training in a recovery deficit.</p>
<p>I also noticed my joints complained more. Shoulders especially. When you're benching on Monday, overhead pressing on that same push day, then hitting shoulders again Thursday, you need bulletproof recovery. Mine wasn't bulletproof anymore.</p>

<h2>Why Upper/Lower Started Working Better</h2>
<p>Switching to Upper/Lower gave me something I didn't realize I needed: mandatory rest days woven into the week. I train Monday, Tuesday, take Wednesday off, train Thursday, Friday, then have the entire weekend to recover.</p>
<p>Those built-in rest days aren't wasted. My body actually uses them. I noticed I was hitting PRs more consistently because I was coming into each session genuinely fresh, not just "good enough" to train.</p>
<p>Here's my current split:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Monday (Upper A):</strong> Bench press, barbell rows, overhead press, pull-ups, face pulls</li>
  <li><strong>Tuesday (Lower A):</strong> Squats, Romanian deadlifts, leg press, calf raises</li>
  <li><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Off</li>
  <li><strong>Thursday (Upper B):</strong> Incline dumbbell press, deadlifts, dumbbell shoulder press, cable rows, curls and triceps</li>
  <li><strong>Friday (Lower B):</strong> Front squats, leg curls, Bulgarian split squats, core work</li>
  <li><strong>Weekend:</strong> Off</li>
</ul>
<p>Each session runs about 75 minutes. I'm not rushing. I'm getting more total volume per muscle group per session compared to PPL, but with more recovery time between hitting those same muscles again.</p>
<p>The deadlifts on Thursday took some getting used to—I moved them to upper day because they're so taxing on the lower back and central nervous system that doing them on leg day was wrecking my Friday session. This is the kind of adjustment you make based on how your body actually responds, not what some program template says.</p>
<p>I take <div style="border:1px solid #e5e7eb;border-radius:12px;padding:16px;margin:16px 0;display:flex;gap:16px;align-items:center;background:#fafafa;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002DYIZEO?tag=dailydealdarl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored" style="flex-shrink:0;"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/P/B002DYIZEO.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg" alt="creatine monohydrate" width="90" height="90" style="object-fit:contain;border-radius:8px;background:#f8f8f8;padding:4px;" loading="lazy" onerror="this.parentElement.style.display='none'"></a><div><strong style="display:block;margin-bottom:8px;font-size:1em;color:#111;">creatine monohydrate</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002DYIZEO?tag=dailydealdarl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored" style="display:inline-block;background:#FF9900;color:#111;padding:7px 18px;border-radius:6px;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;font-size:0.88em;">Check Price on Amazon →</a></div></div> daily now (5g, nothing fancy), and I'm convinced it helps with session-to-session recovery. I started it around the same time I switched splits, and my working weights went up despite training fewer days per week.</p>
<h2>The Real Decision Factors</h2>
<p><strong>Choose PPL if:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>You can genuinely commit to 6 days per week without it stressing you out</li>
  <li>Your recovery is still solid (you sleep 7-8 hours consistently, manage stress well)</li>
  <li>You prefer shorter, focused sessions over longer workouts</li>
  <li>You're not dealing with any nagging joint issues</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Choose Upper/Lower if:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>You want built-in recovery days</li>
  <li>Four gym days per week fits your schedule better</li>
  <li>You're dealing with joint fatigue or minor recurring issues</li>
  <li>You're focused on the big compound lifts and don't mind slightly longer sessions</li>
  <li>You've noticed your recovery isn't what it used to be</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not going to tell you PPL is "wrong" after 35. I know guys my age running it successfully. But they're also the guys sleeping 8 hours, managing stress, eating enough protein, and not skipping mobility work. If that's not you right now—and it wasn't me—Upper/Lower gives you more margin for error.</p>
<p>The other factor: life chaos. When work explodes or family needs ramp up, missing one day on an Upper/Lower split doesn't derail your week. You're still hitting everything. Missing a day on PPL throws off your rotation and you start playing catch-up.</p>
<h2>What Actually Moves the Needle</h2>
<p>Neither split matters if you're not progressive overloading and eating enough protein. I shoot for 180-200g daily (I'm 195 pounds). The split just determines how you organize the work.</p>
<p>What helped me most wasn't the split itself—it was matching the split to my actual recovery capacity right now. When I was fighting my body's need for rest, trying to prove I could still train like I did at 28, my progress stalled. When I accepted that four focused days with genuine recovery produced better results than six partially-recovered days, everything clicked.</p>
<p>I also added <div style="border:1px solid #e5e7eb;border-radius:12px;padding:16px;margin:16px 0;display:flex;gap:16px;align-items:center;background:#fafafa;"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BD0RT0?tag=dailydealdarl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored" style="flex-shrink:0;"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/P/B000BD0RT0.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg" alt="magnesium glycinate" width="90" height="90" style="object-fit:contain;border-radius:8px;background:#f8f8f8;padding:4px;" loading="lazy" onerror="this.parentElement.style.display='none'"></a><div><strong style="display:block;margin-bottom:8px;font-size:1em;color:#111;">magnesium glycinate</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BD0RT0?tag=dailydealdarl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored" style="display:inline-block;background:#FF9900;color:#111;padding:7px 18px;border-radius:6px;text-decoration:none;font-weight:700;font-size:0.88em;">Check Price on Amazon →</a></div></div> before bed (400mg), and my sleep quality improved noticeably. Better sleep means better recovery, which means both splits work better—but I still think Upper/Lower is more forgiving for men over 35 fitness goals.</p>
<h2>My Take After a Year on Each</h2>
<p>I got stronger on Upper/Lower. Not because the split is magically better, but because I was consistently training at 90-95% capacity instead of 70-80% capacity on tired days with PPL.</p>
<p>My joints feel better. My motivation is higher because I'm not dragging myself to the gym six days straight. And I'm still hitting every muscle group twice per week with plenty of volume.</p>
<p>If you're considering switching from PPL, try Upper/Lower for 8 weeks. Track your lifts, track how you feel, and make the decision based on results, not theory. I thought I'd miss the sixth training day. I don't. I'm making better progress with less time in the gym because that time is higher quality.</p>
<p>If you're starting fresh and trying to decide, I'd lean toward Upper/Lower unless you have unlimited recovery capacity and love being in the gym six days a week. We're building sustainable muscle building after 35, not trying to win a "who trains most" contest.</p>
<h2>My Top Picks for Recovery and Performance</h2>
<p>These are the three supplements that made the biggest difference when I switched splits and started prioritizing recovery:</p>
