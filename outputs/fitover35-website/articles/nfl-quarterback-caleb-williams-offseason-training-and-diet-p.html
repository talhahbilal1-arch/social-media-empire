<h1>5 QB Training Secrets From Caleb Williams That Actually Build Muscle After 35</h1>
<p>Look, I'm not squatting 405 pounds for reps. Neither are you, probably. Caleb Williams is 22 years old and plays quarterback in the NFL. But when I dug into his offseason training protocol, I found five principles that actually translate to guys like us who are trying to stay strong and athletic past 35.</p>
<p>I've been lifting consistently for three years now, and the biggest lesson I've learned is this: elite athlete training works when you adapt it to your reality. You don't need to train like you're preparing for the NFL Combine. You need to train smart, eat enough protein, and recover properly.</p>
<p>Here's what Williams does that you can steal.</p>
<h2>Heavy Squats Build Everything (But Start Where You Are)</h2>
<p>Williams reportedly squats 405 pounds for sets of five. That's insane. But the principle matters more than the number: he prioritizes heavy compound movements three times per week.</p>
<p>I squat three days a week. Started at 135 pounds at age 35. Now I'm at 245 for sets of five. The gains came slowly, but they came consistently because I stuck with the frequency.</p>
<p>Here's my actual split that's worked for men over 35 fitness:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Monday</strong>: Back squats, 3 sets of 5, heavy</li>
  <li><strong>Wednesday</strong>: Front squats or goblet squats, 3 sets of 8</li>
  <li><strong>Friday</strong>: Back squats again, 3 sets of 5</li>
</ul>
<p>The magic is in the frequency. Your body adapts when you give it a consistent stimulus. Once a week isn't enough. Three times hits the sweet spot where you're building strength without destroying yourself.</p>
<p>If you're starting from zero, do goblet squats with a 25-pound dumbbell three times a week. Add 5 pounds every two weeks. In six months, you'll be amazed at what you can move.</p>
<h2>The 40-Gram Post-Workout Window Is Real</h2>
<p>Williams follows a strict protocol: 40 grams of protein within 90 minutes after training. I ignored this for my first year of lifting. Big mistake.</p>
<p>Your muscles are screaming for protein right after you train. I don't care if you're 25 or 45—this window matters. Since I started hitting 40 grams post-workout, my recovery improved noticeably. Less soreness, better energy the next day.</p>

<p>My go-to is simple: two scoops of whey protein (50g) mixed with water right in the gym parking lot. Tastes like crap, works like magic. Or if I trained at home, I'll do 8 ounces of Greek yogurt (20g) plus a protein shake (30g).</p>
<p>The 90-minute window gives you flexibility. You don't need to chug a shake mid-workout. Just don't go home, shower, watch TV, and eat dinner three hours later. That's leaving gains on the table.</p>
<p>For supplements for men over 35, I keep it minimal. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002DYIZEO?tag=dailydealdarl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored">Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey</a></strong> — mixes easily, doesn't upset my stomach, and actually tastes decent compared to cheaper brands.</p>
<h2>Box Jumps Build the Explosive Power You're Losing</h2>
<p>This one surprised me. Williams does plyometric box jumps as part of his training. Quarterbacks need explosive power to escape pressure and drive the ball downfield.</p>
<p>You need it to feel athletic. To keep up with your kids. To not move like an old man.</p>
<p>I started doing box jumps six months ago. Just a 20-inch box, three sets of five jumps, once a week. My knees were skeptical at first, but here's the key: land soft. Control the descent. This isn't about maximum height—it's about maintaining fast-twitch muscle fiber.</p>
<p>Men over 35 lose explosive power faster than strength. You can still squat heavy at 45, but your vertical jump drops off a cliff if you don't train it. Box jumps fix this.</p>
<p>Start conservative. A 12-inch step is fine. Focus on explosive drive off the ground and soft landing. Add height every month. This single exercise has made me feel more athletic than anything else I've added to my workout plan over 35.</p>
<h2>Creatine Before Training (Not All Day)</h2>
<p>Williams uses creatine and electrolytes specifically pre-training. Not morning, noon, and night. Just before he works.</p>
<p>I used to take creatine whenever I remembered—morning coffee, afternoon, random. Then I switched to Williams' protocol: 5 grams of creatine plus electrolytes 30 minutes before lifting.</p>
<p>The difference is noticeable. Better pumps, more endurance on those last reps, less cramping. Creatine works by increasing your muscles' phosphocreatine stores, which helps produce more ATP during high-intensity exercise. Taking it pre-workout means it's available exactly when you need it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002DYIZEO?tag=dailydealdarl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored">Creatine Monohydrate</a></strong> — skip the fancy versions, plain monohydrate is all you need and it's dirt cheap.</p>
<p>For electrolytes, I just add a quarter teaspoon of sea salt to my water bottle. Costs nothing, works great. If you want a premade option, any basic electrolyte powder without sugar works fine.</p>
<p>This is one of those muscle building after 35 hacks that sounds too simple to matter, but the cumulative effect over months is significant.</p>
<h2>Sleep Isn't Optional (And 8 Hours Is the Floor)</h2>
<p>Williams sleeps minimum 8 hours every night. NFL teams monitor this stuff now. They know recovery happens during sleep, not in the gym.</p>
<p>I fought this reality for a year. Tried to build muscle on 6 hours of sleep because I'm busy. Didn't work. My lifts stalled, I felt like garbage, and I actually gained belly fat despite training four days a week.</p>
<p>When I committed to 8 hours minimum, everything changed. Lifts went up. Energy improved. Started actually losing belly fat men struggle with in their 30s and 40s.</p>
<p>Your body releases growth hormone during deep sleep. Testosterone production happens primarily while you sleep. If you're trying to build muscle after 35 with inadequate sleep, you're fighting biology.</p>
<p>My sleep stack that actually works:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BD0RT0?tag=dailydealdarl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored">Magnesium Glycinate</a></strong> — 400mg before bed helps me fall asleep faster and sleep deeper without morning grogginess.</li>
  <li>Room temperature at 67 degrees</li>
  <li>No screens after 9 PM (I read actual books now like a caveman)</li>
  <li>Blackout curtains</li>
</ul>
<p>The magnesium made the biggest difference. I was skeptical about supplements, but this one clearly improves my sleep quality.</p>
<h2>What This Actually Looks Like in Real Life</h2>
<p>You're not Caleb Williams. You have a job, maybe kids, responsibilities. You can't train like a professional athlete. But you can steal these five principles and adapt them.</p>
<p>My current routine combines all five:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Heavy squats 3x per week (Monday/Wednesday/Friday)</li>
  <li>40g protein shake immediately after every workout</li>
  <li>Box jumps once per week (Fridays after squats)</li>
  <li>Creatine and salt water 30 minutes before lifting</li>
  <li>In bed by 10 PM for 8 hours of sleep</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn't revolutionary. It's just consistent execution of proven principles.</p>
<p>I'm 38, in better shape than I was at 28, and still making progress. You can do this too. Start with the squats. Add the protein timing. Build the habit of sleep. The rest will follow.</p>
<p>Stop looking for the perfect program. This is the program. Now go squat something heavy.</p>
