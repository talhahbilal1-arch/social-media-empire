Let me tell you about the mistake I see constantly.

A guy decides to get serious about training. He's motivated. He finds a program and commits.

Week one: He does every workout, plus extra core work and some cardio "just to be safe."

Week two: He's sore but pushes through. Adds more volume because "more is better."

Week three: Something twinges. Energy is low. Sleep is worse.

Week four: He misses a workout. Then another. The program "isn't working for him."

**The mistake: Doing too much, too soon.**

Here's what most guys don't understand about training after 35:

Your recovery is a limited resource. Every set you do withdraws from that account. If you withdraw more than you deposit (through sleep, nutrition, and rest days), you go into debt.

Debt shows up as:
- Persistent fatigue
- Nagging joint pain
- Stalled progress
- Getting sick more often
- Dreading workouts you used to enjoy

**The fix: Start conservative and build.**

The density training approach in your guide is intentionally minimalist. Two 15-minute blocks. Four exercises total. Thirty minutes of actual work.

Your ego will say "that's not enough." Your ego is wrong.

Start with exactly what the guide prescribes. Do it consistently for 4 weeks. Only then consider adding anything.

This feels counterintuitive if you're used to the "go hard or go home" mentality. But that mentality is why most guys quit. They sprint, burn out, and stop.

You're not sprinting. You're building something that lasts 30 years.

**The identity shift:** Smart trainees find the minimum effective dose. They understand that consistency over time beats intensity over weeks.

Do less than you think you need. Do it for longer than you think matters.

That's the formula.

Talk soon,

**Fit Over 35**

P.S. - If you're recovering from the "too much, too soon" trap right now, reply and tell me where you're at. Sometimes you need to scale back before you can build back up.
