Welcome to Fit Over 35.

You signed up because you want something different. Not another program that assumes you have two hours a day to train. Not another approach that works great until life gets busy.

You want results that fit your reality.

**Here's your guide:** [DOWNLOAD: The 5-Day Density Training Starter Guide]

Inside, you'll learn:

- Why density training works better than traditional programs for busy professionals
- The exact workout template you'll use for months (not weeks)
- Nutrition basics that survive business dinners and travel
- Recovery strategies that don't require expensive equipment
- How to build an identity that keeps you consistent for decades

This isn't motivational fluff. It's a system.

**What to do now:**

1. Download the guide
2. Read Day 1 today
3. Do the Day 2 workout within the next 48 hours
4. Actually write down your numbers (this matters)

Over the next two weeks, I'll send you a few emails with additional strategies and resources. Nothing excessive—just practical content that builds on what you're learning.

If this isn't useful, unsubscribe anytime. No hard feelings.

But if you commit to the next 30 days, you'll see why men stick with this approach for years.

Let's build something sustainable.

Talk soon,

**Fit Over 35**
