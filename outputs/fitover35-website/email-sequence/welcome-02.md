Here's something that takes 2 minutes and makes every workout better.

Most guys walk into the gym cold and start loading weight. Then they wonder why the first few sets feel terrible and their joints ache.

**The fix: A 90-second movement primer.**

Before any training session, do this:

- 10 arm circles (each direction)
- 10 leg swings (each leg, front to back)
- 10 deep squat holds (just bodyweight, 2 seconds each)
- 5 push-ups (slow and controlled)

That's it. Takes 90 seconds once you know it.

What this does:

1. Raises your core temperature
2. Lubricates your joints with synovial fluid
3. Activates your nervous system
4. Mentally transitions you into training mode

You'll notice your first working set feels better. Your joints move smoother. Your mind is actually in the workout instead of still processing your last meeting.

**The identity piece:** Men who train seriously don't skip the primer. It's part of the ritual. Not because someone told them to—because they've learned that preparation beats winging it.

Add this before your next density training session. Notice the difference.

Small systems create big results.
