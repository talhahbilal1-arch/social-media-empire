Let me share something from a guy who was where you might be right now.

**Mike, 42, financial advisor, two kids, "no time for the gym."**

A year ago, Mike's story sounded familiar:

- Hadn't trained consistently in 8 years
- Started and stopped multiple programs
- Felt like his body was declining and there was nothing he could do
- Convinced himself his schedule made fitness impossible

He found the density training approach and was skeptical. Thirty minutes felt too short. The program felt too simple. There had to be a catch.

He committed to 30 days anyway.

**What happened:**

**Month 1:** He didn't miss a single session. The time-boxed structure meant no workout ever "ran long" and disrupted his schedule. His baseline numbers improved every week.

**Month 3:** His pants fit differently. Coworkers asked if he'd lost weight. He'd actually gained 4 pounds—but his waist was down an inch. His energy at 3pm stopped crashing.

**Month 6:** Training wasn't a chore anymore. It was just what he did. Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Non-negotiable. He'd built the identity.

**Month 12:** At his annual physical, his doctor noted improved blood pressure, better cholesterol numbers, and told him to "keep doing whatever you're doing."

But here's what Mike says mattered most:

*"I can keep up with my kids now. I'm not winded playing basketball with my son. I carried both kids up the stairs without thinking about it. That's the stuff that actually matters."*

**The system works because it fits life.**

Mike didn't restructure his schedule. He didn't wake up at 5am. He didn't sacrifice family time.

He found 30 minutes three times per week. He protected that time. He showed up consistently.

The results followed the consistency, not the other way around.

**You don't need more time than you have.** You need a system that uses the time you can actually commit.

That's what you have now.

Talk soon,

**Fit Over 35**

P.S. - One year from now, you'll be a year older regardless. The question is whether you'll be a year stronger. The system is in your hands. The choice is yours.

## Design Notes

- Story-driven format creates connection
- Use the month-by-month breakdown for easy scanning
- The quoted section should stand out (italics or blockquote style)
- P.S. creates urgency through identity and future self
- If you have real testimonials, replace "Mike" with actual user stories
