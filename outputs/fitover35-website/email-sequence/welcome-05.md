**Preview Text:** You've got the foundation. Here's how to build on it.

You've had the guide for over a week now.

If you've been following along, you've already:

- Done at least 3 density training sessions
- Started thinking about protein at every meal
- Maybe even protected your sleep a bit more

That's not nothing. That's a foundation.

Now let's talk about what comes next.

**The honest truth:** The guide gives you everything you need to make progress for months. No additional programs required. No upsells. Just execute what you have.

But I know how it goes. Questions come up. Life creates new obstacles. You want to go deeper on specific topics.

That's what the rest of Fit Over 35 is for.

**Here's what I recommend as your next steps:**

**1. Keep training with the foundation workout for at least 4 more weeks.**

Don't switch programs. Don't add complexity. Focus on beating your numbers from last session. Progressive overload through density is your driver.

**2. Go deeper on the topics that challenge you most.**

On the Fit Over 35 site, I've written extensively about:

- **Training variations** when you're ready to evolve the basic template
- **Travel workouts** that don't require a gym
- **Nutrition strategies** for specific situations (business dinners, late meetings, travel)
- **Recovery optimization** when life stress is high
- **Mindset frameworks** for building unshakeable consistency

Browse what's relevant to your situation. Ignore what isn't.

**3. Consider going deeper with structured guidance.**

If self-directed training works for you, stay with it. The free content is comprehensive.

But if you want:
- Weekly workout programming that evolves as you progress
- Direct feedback on your training and nutrition
- A community of guys working toward the same goals
- Accountability that keeps you consistent

That's what the Fit Over 35 membership provides. It's not for everyone, but for the right person, it accelerates everything.

**No pressure either way.** Seriously.

The free resources are substantial. Most guys can make excellent progress with the guide and blog content alone. I built it that way intentionally.

But if you want more structure and support, the option exists.

**For now, focus on this:**

Show up three times this week. Do the work. Beat your numbers. Build the identity.

Everything else is secondary.

Talk soon,

**Fit Over 35**

P.S. - I'll continue sending occasional emails with training tips and strategies. If there's a specific topic you want me to cover, reply and tell me. Your input shapes the content I create.
