          <h3>The Short Version</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a natural bodybuilder, coach, and educator with over 15 years in the fitness industry. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Kinesiology and a Master's in Education. I've competed, coached, and made every mistake in the book so you don't have to.
          </p>
          <p>
            FitOver35 exists because I got tired of watching intelligent men follow advice that was never designed for them. The fitness industry is built for the genetically gifted 22-year-old with nothing but time. That's not who I write for.
          </p>

          <h3>The Philosophy</h3>
          <p>
            I believe fitness after 35 is fundamentally different. Not because you're broken, but because the equation has changed. Recovery takes longer. Joints carry history. Hormones shift. Life demands more of your time and energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here's what most people miss: these changes aren't limitations. They're invitations to train smarter. The men who thrive after 35 aren't the ones who fight their biology. They're the ones who learn to work with it.
          </p>

          <h3>The Approach</h3>
          <p>
            Everything here is built on three pillars: evidence-based methodology, practical application, and long-term sustainability. I don't care about what looks good on Instagram. I care about what works in the real world, for real people, over years and decades.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means training programs that respect your recovery capacity. Nutrition strategies that fit your life. And a mindset shift from chasing quick results to building permanent capability.

  <!-- My Story -->
  <section class="section section--gray">
    <div class="container container--narrow">
      <h2 class="section__title text-center mb-lg">The Longer Story</h2>

      <p>
        I started training at 19 because I was tired of being the skinny guy. Like most people, I did everything wrong at first. Too much volume, not enough food, chasing pump over progress. I read every magazine, tried every supplement, followed every pro's routine.
      </p>

      <p>
        By 25, I was competing in natural bodybuilding and had started coaching. The academic side came next. A degree in Kinesiology taught me the science behind what I'd been learning through trial and error. A Master's in Education taught me how to actually communicate it.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the real education came at 35.
      </p>

      <p>
        That was when everything I thought I knew stopped working. The same training that had built my physique for over a decade suddenly started breaking me down. Nagging injuries. Stalled progress. The frustrating realization that I couldn't just outwork bad programming anymore.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I went back to the research. Talked to coaches who specialized in masters athletes. Experimented on myself. Tracked everything obsessively. And slowly, I developed a different approach. One built for the body I actually had, not the body I used to have.
      </p>

      <p>
        The results surprised me. At 40, I was stronger than I'd been at 30. At 45, my body composition was better than my competitive days. Not because of some secret supplement or revolutionary program. Because I'd finally learned to train with my physiology instead of against it.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's what FitOver35 is about. Taking everything I've learned from 15+ years on both sides of the research and the barbell and translating it into systems that work for men who are past the point where they can get away with mediocre programming.
