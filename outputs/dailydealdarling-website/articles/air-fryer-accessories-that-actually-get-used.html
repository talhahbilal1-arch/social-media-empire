<h1>5 Air Fryer Accessories That Actually Get Used (Not Collecting Dust)</h1>
<p>Okay, confession time: I bought an air fryer accessory set last year with like 12 pieces, and I've used maybe three of them. The little silicone cups? Still in the box. The skewer rack? Honestly forgot I owned it until just now.</p>
<p>But here's the thing—there ARE air fryer accessories that completely changed how I use mine. I'm talking about the stuff I reach for multiple times a week, not the things that sounded cool on Amazon and then became kitchen drawer clutter.</p>
<p>So let me save you from my mistakes and share the five accessories I actually use. These are the best home finds that make air frying faster, easier, and way less annoying.</p>
<h2>Parchment Paper Liners (The One Thing I'll Never Skip)</h2>
<p>Listen, I resisted these for SO long because they felt wasteful. But after scrubbing stuck-on cheese off my air fryer basket for the millionth time, I caved and bought the pre-cut parchment liners with holes.</p>
<p>Game. Changer.</p>
<p>They're not the fancy silicone kind (we'll get to those), just disposable parchment rounds that fit perfectly in the basket. What I love is that cleanup literally takes 10 seconds now. You just lift out the liner and toss it. No soaking, no scrubbing with that weird brush thing that came with your air fryer.</p>
<p>I use mine for everything messy—marinated chicken, breaded stuff, anything with sauce. They don't affect cooking at all because of the perforated holes, and honestly? It's made me use my air fryer way more because I'm not dreading the cleanup.</p>
<p>Pro tip: Get the unbleached ones if you can find them. They work exactly the same but feel slightly less wasteful, if that makes sense.</p>
<h2>Silicone Basket or Reusable Mat</h2>
<p>Okay, so I just said the disposable liners are my favorite, but hear me out—I also keep a silicone basket on hand for certain things.</p>
<p>The difference? I use the silicone one when I'm cooking something that might drip or when I want to shake things around without food falling through the basket holes. Think: roasted vegetables, small potato wedges, Brussels sprouts.</p>
<p>My silicone basket has handles which makes it stupidly easy to pull out and shake everything around halfway through cooking. No tongs needed, no awkward basket-shaking that sends a sweet potato flying across your kitchen (just me?).</p>
<p>The cleanup on these is pretty easy—they go right in the dishwasher. Mine's lasted over a year with zero issues, which makes it worth the $15 I spent.</p>
<p>What I don't use it for: anything breaded or anything I want super crispy. It creates a tiny bit of barrier between food and heat, so your fries won't be quite as crispy as they would be directly on the basket.</p>

<h2>A Simple Spray Oil Bottle</h2>
<p>This isn't technically an air fryer-specific accessory, but it's probably the thing that improved my results the most.</p>
<p>You know how recipes always say "lightly spray with oil"? I used to just... drizzle olive oil from the bottle and hope for the best. Things either came out too oily or weirdly dry and stuck to everything.</p>
<p>A spray bottle lets you get that super light, even coating that actually makes food crispy instead of greasy. I'm not talking about those aerosol cooking sprays (those can actually damage non-stick surfaces over time). I mean a refillable pump or trigger spray bottle that you fill with whatever oil you want.</p>
<p>I use mine probably 4-5 times a week. Frozen fries, vegetables, chicken—everything gets a light spray before it goes in. It's one of those kitchen gadgets worth buying that you'll use for way more than just air frying.</p>
<p>Plus you save money because you're using your own oil instead of buying those expensive spray cans. And you can use good olive oil or avocado oil, not whatever mystery oil is in the aerosol version.</p>
<h2>Cake Barrel or Small Baking Pan</h2>
<p>I know, I know—who's baking cakes in their air fryer? But stay with me.</p>
<p>I bought a 7-inch round cake pan that fits in my air fryer, and I use it all the time... but not for cake. I use it for frittatas, small casseroles, baked oatmeal, even reheating pizza (it keeps the toppings from flying around everywhere).</p>
<p>It's basically turned my air fryer into a tiny oven, which is perfect for summer when I don't want to heat up my whole kitchen. I've made mac and cheese for two, little personal meatloaves, even a small pan of brownies.</p>
<p>The key is getting one that's actually designed for air fryers—it needs to be the right size and have enough clearance for air to circulate. Mine's about 3 inches deep and 7 inches across, which fits perfectly in my 5.8-quart air fryer with room for airflow.</p>
<p>This has become one of my most-used accessories because it's so versatile. Way more useful than those weird egg bite molds or corn holders that came in that accessory set.</p>
<h2>Good Tongs (Seriously, Just Good Tongs)</h2>
<p>This sounds too simple to count, but it matters.</p>
<p>Regular tongs are either too long to fit comfortably in the air fryer or too short to protect your hands from the heat. I got a pair of 9-inch silicone-tipped tongs specifically for my air fryer, and I use them literally every single time.</p>
<p>They're perfect for flipping chicken, rearranging vegetables, pulling out that silicone basket I mentioned earlier. The silicone tips won't scratch your basket (important if you want your air fryer to last), and the shorter length means you're not awkwardly wrestling with them in a small space.</p>
<p>I keep mine in a drawer right next to my air fryer so they're always there when I need them. Such a small thing, but it makes the whole cooking process smoother.</p>
<h2>What Didn't Make the Cut</h2>
<p>Can we talk about the accessories I DON'T use? Because I feel like every air fryer accessory set tries to convince you that you need 47 different tools.</p>
<p>The metal skewers? Never touched them. That weird rack thing for making multiple layers? Used it once, hated washing it. Pizza pan with holes? My regular cake barrel works better. Corn holders, silicone cupcake molds, egg bite makers—all still in the box.</p>
<p>The honest truth is that most air fryer cooking is pretty straightforward. You don't need specialized tools for every possible food. You need the basics that make cleanup easier and cooking more convenient.</p>
<h2>Making Air Frying Actually Work for You</h2>
<p>Here's what I've learned after two years of regular air fryer use: the accessories that actually help are the ones that either make cleanup faster or make the cooking process easier. That's it.</p>
<p>Parchment liners save you from scrubbing. A silicone basket makes shaking food around effortless. A spray bottle gives you control over oil. A small pan expands what you can make. Good tongs make everything safer and easier.</p>
<p>You don't need a 12-piece accessory set. You need these five things, and you'll actually use your air fryer way more because it won't feel like a hassle.</p>
<p>If you're looking for more kitchen gadgets worth buying or home organization ideas to declutter all those unused accessories, start by figuring out what you actually reach for versus what just sounds cool. Trust me, your kitchen drawers will thank you.</p>
<p>And if you're still shopping for an <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FDJMC9Q?tag=dailydealdarl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored">air fryer</a></strong>—I have the 5.8-quart version and it's perfect for two people or a small family.</p>
<p>Now go use that air fryer you bought six months ago. With the right accessories, I promise you'll actually want to.</p>
