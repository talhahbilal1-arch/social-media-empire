# Presidents Day Mattress Sales 2026: How to Actually Get a Good Deal (Not Just a Big Discount)

Most of us wait 10-15 years to replace our mattress, but research suggests mattresses lose about 10% of their support every three years—which means we're all sleeping on something way past its prime and wondering why our backs hurt.

According to the Better Sleep Council, 92% of us know a comfortable mattress matters for good sleep, yet we're sleeping on ancient ones anyway. And honestly? I get it. Mattresses are expensive, confusing, and it's hard to know when a "sale" is actually a sale.

But here's the thing about Presidents Day weekend: it's one of the few times when mattress deals are genuinely worth paying attention to. The National Retail Federation ranks it as the fourth-largest shopping holiday in the US, with furniture and bedding as top categories. Consumer Reports data shows these sales typically offer 20-50% off—matching or beating Black Friday prices.

The catch? You have to know what you're actually paying, not just what discount percentage is being waved in your face.

## The Mattress Markup Game: Why That "60% Off" Might Be Total BS

Last year I spent three hours comparing Presidents Day mattress deals, convinced I was getting an incredible discount on a $2,400 mattress marked down to $1,200. Then I found the exact same model at a different retailer for $1,100 with a smaller discount percentage. That's when I realized mattress shopping during sales requires a completely different strategy than I thought.

Here's what most mattress stores do: they set artificially high "regular prices" that barely anyone ever pays, then run constant sales showing massive discounts. A mattress might be "50% off $2,000" at one store and "30% off $1,200" at another—you're paying $1,000 either way.

Dr. Bill Fish, a sleep science coach and founder of Sleep.com, warns consumers to ignore those inflated original prices completely and focus on comparing actual out-the-door costs across retailers. Add in delivery fees, old mattress removal charges, and look at the real bottom line.

The way I shop mattress sales now: I open a spreadsheet (yes, really) and track the final price after all fees at each retailer. Not the discount percentage. Not the "original" price. Just what I'll actually pay when everything's delivered and my old mattress is gone.

## When Your Mattress Is Actually Costing You Sleep

Dr. Michael Breus, a clinical psychologist and sleep specialist known as The Sleep Doctor, recommends replacing your mattress every 7-8 years for optimal sleep health. He notes that worn mattresses can contribute to back pain, poor sleep quality, and even allergy symptoms from accumulated dust mites. (Gross, but true.)

Research from the Sleep Foundation backs this up—mattresses lose about 10% of their support every three years, with significant decline after 7-8 years. But here's the part that got my attention: a study published in the Journal of Chiropractic Medicine found that people who switched to newer mattresses (less than 5 years old) saw a 55% improvement in sleep quality and major reductions in back pain.

Fifty-five percent! That's not a small difference.

If you're waking up stiff, tossing and turning more than you used to, or noticing visible sagging or lumps in your mattress, this Presidents Day might actually be the right time to buy. Not because of the marketing hype, but because your body is telling you something.

## What I Actually Look for in a Presidents Day Mattress Deal

Forget the discount percentage for a second. Here's what makes a mattress deal worth it to me:

**The real price is competitive.** I check at least three retailers and compare final costs. If a "sale" price is what the mattress costs year-round elsewhere, it's not a deal.

**The trial period is solid.** I want at least 90 nights, ideally 120. You can't tell if a mattress works for you in two weeks. Your body needs time to adjust.

**Returns are actually free.** Some places charge restocking fees or make you pay return shipping on a mattress. Hard pass.

**Old mattress removal is included.** This costs $100-150 if you arrange it separately, so it matters.

**The warranty means something.** Look for 10+ years, and read what it actually covers. Some warranties are basically useless after the first few years.

The Consumer Reports testing team found something I think about constantly: higher price doesn't always equal better quality. Many mid-range mattresses in the $800-$1,500 range performed just as well as luxury models costing $3,000+ in their durability and support tests.

That freed me up to focus on finding a mattress that works for my body, not the most expensive one I could justify.

## Best Mattress Types to Consider (And What I'd Actually Buy)

**Memory foam mattresses** are great if you sleep on your side and want pressure relief. They contour to your body but can sleep hot. I'd look for one with gel infusion or copper if you run warm at night.

**Hybrid mattresses** (memory foam or latex on top, coils underneath) are my personal favorite. You get contouring where you need it but better airflow and bounce than pure foam. This is what I switched to two years ago and my sleep quality genuinely improved.

**Innerspring mattresses** are the traditional option—more bounce, better cooling, usually less expensive. Good if you're a stomach sleeper or prefer a firmer, more "traditional" mattress feel.

**Latex mattresses** are naturally cooling and durable, but pricey. If you're planning to keep it for 10+ years and hate feeling stuck in your mattress, latex is worth considering during a good sale.

For Presidents Day specifically, I'd focus on hybrid mattresses in the $1,000-$1,500 range after discounts. That's the sweet spot where quality meets value, based on everything I've researched and tried myself.

## Furniture Sales That Are Actually Good (And Which Ones to Skip)

Presidents Day furniture sales can be just as good as the mattress deals—but you have to be selective.

**Worth your time:** Sofas, dining sets, bedroom furniture (bed frames, dressers, nightstands). These are big-ticket items where you'll see real savings, often 30-40% off. The National Retail Federation confirms furniture is a top-selling category this weekend for good reason.

**Usually fine but not spectacular:** Desks, office chairs, accent chairs. You'll find sales, but they're often similar to what you'd get during other times of year. Don't rush unless you actually need it now.

**Skip it:** Small decor items, lamps, rugs, wall art. The "sales" on these are often negligible. You'll find better deals on affordable home decor throughout the year, especially at places like HomeGoods or during end-of-season clearances.

One thing I learned the hard way: furniture delivery timelines can be 6-12 weeks right now, even longer for custom pieces. If you're buying for a specific move-in date or room makeover deadline, factor that in. A great deal doesn't help if it arrives three months late.

**West Elm Mid-Century Sofa** — I've had mine for four years and it still looks great. If you see this on sale for under $1,200 during Presidents Day, grab it. The quality is there and it actually holds up to real life (and cats, and red wine). [AFFILIATE_LINK_PLACEHOLDER:deals:furniture]

## The Fine Print Nobody Reads (But You Should)

**Delivery fees** can add $100-200 to your purchase. Some retailers waive this during sales, others don't. Always check before you click buy.

**Old mattress removal** might be "free" but only if you remember to select it during checkout. Otherwise you're stuck with a giant old mattress in your garage.

**White glove delivery** (where they set everything up and take away packaging) costs extra but is worth it for furniture. Assembly is more complicated than you think, especially for bed frames and dressers.

**Return windows** often start from delivery date, not purchase date. If your mattress takes three weeks to arrive, you might only have 70 days to try it, not 90.

**Financing offers** sound great—0% APR for 12 months!—but read the terms. Some charge retroactive interest on the full original balance if you don't pay it off in time. I'd rather save up and pay cash than deal with that stress.

## My Actual Strategy for This Presidents Day

Here's what I'm doing (because yes, I need a new mattress for my guest room):

1. I've already identified three mattresses in my price range that have good reviews from actual owners, not just marketing copy
2. I'm tracking prices at multiple retailers starting this week to see the real baseline
3. On Presidents Day, I'm comparing final costs including delivery and old mattress removal
4. I'm reading return policies one more time before I buy
5. I'm checking if my credit card offers extended warranty protection (mine adds an extra year, which is nice)

I'm NOT getting distracted by the biggest discount percentage. I'm NOT assuming "60% off" means it's the best deal. And I'm definitely not buying based on fancy marketing about "NASA technology" or "hotel luxury" unless the price and reviews actually back it up.

The Consumer Reports team is right—you don't need to spend $3,000 to sleep well. You just need to spend smartly and focus on what actually matters: support, comfort for your sleep position, and a price that doesn't make you wince.

**Casper Original Hybrid Mattress** — This is consistently well-reviewed in the $1,000-$1,200 range during sales, and people I know who own it are genuinely happy with it years later. Good balance of support and comfort without the luxury markup. [AFFILIATE_LINK_PLACEHOLDER:deals:mattresses]

## Is Presidents Day Worth It for Mattress Shopping?

Yes, but only if you do the math.

This is legitimately one of the best times to buy a mattress or major furniture pieces. The sales are real, the inventory is good, and you're not fighting the crowds like you would on Black Friday.

But you have to be smarter than the marketing. Track actual prices, read return policies, factor in all the fees, and ignore the discount percentages that are designed to make you think you're getting a better deal than you are.

Your back will thank you for getting a new mattress if yours is past its prime. Your wallet will thank you for not overpaying just because a sale sign was big and red.

And honestly? Waking up without back pain and actually sleeping through the night is worth way more than whatever you'll spend this weekend. Just make sure you're spending it wisely.
