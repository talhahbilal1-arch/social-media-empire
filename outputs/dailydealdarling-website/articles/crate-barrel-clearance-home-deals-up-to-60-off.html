<h1>Crate & Barrel Clearance: 5 Home Finds I'm Actually Buying Before They Sell Out</h1>
<p>Okay, so I was just browsing Crate & Barrel's clearance section (as one does on a Tuesday night), and holy crap, there are some legitimately good deals happening right now. Not the "clearance" where they mark something down from $200 to $195, but actual up-to-60%-off prices on stuff I would genuinely buy.</p>
<p>I'm writing this because I know some of you have been wanting to refresh your space without dropping a fortune, and this is one of those moments where the timing actually works out. I've spent the last hour comparing prices, checking reviews, and honestly adding way too many things to my own cart.</p>
<p>Here's what's actually worth your time, and what you should probably skip.</p>
<h2>Those Belgian Linen Curtains Everyone Wants Are 65% Off</h2>
<p>Listen, I've been eyeing Crate & Barrel's Belgian linen curtains for like two years. They're normally $129-$149 per panel, which is just... a lot for curtains. Right now? They're down to $45-$52 per panel depending on the size.</p>
<p>The catch: neutral colors are disappearing fast. I'm talking about the ivory, natural, and that perfect greige color that goes with everything. The brighter colors (like terracotta and navy) are still pretty well-stocked, but if you want those go-with-anything neutrals, don't wait.</p>
<p>I compared these to the linen curtains from West Elm and Pottery Barn, and honestly, the quality is nearly identical. Same Belgian linen, same nice drape, same pre-washed finish so they won't shrink weird when you clean them. The only difference is Crate & Barrel's rod pocket is slightly larger, which I actually prefer because it fits more curtain rod styles.</p>
<p>One thing: these are 50" wide panels, so depending on your window size, you might need 2-3 panels per window for that full, gathered look. Still way cheaper than buying them at full price.</p>
<h2>Velvet Throw Pillows Under $15 (Yes, Really)</h2>
<p>I grabbed three of these and I'm not even sorry. The 18x18 velvet pillows are marked down to $9.99-$14.99, and they're the same ones that were $34.95 last month.</p>
<p>The quality is surprisingly decent for clearance. The velvet has that nice soft hand-feel, not that scratchy cheap velvet that looks good in photos but feels like cardboard. The zippers are hidden, which is my weird pet peeve with throw pillows—I hate visible zippers.</p>
<p>Color selection is hit or miss. Lots of jewel tones left (emerald green, sapphire blue, burgundy), which actually works great if you're going for that cozy, moody vibe. The blush pink and cream ones are mostly gone, probably because everyone and their mother wanted those for their affordable home decor refresh.</p>
<p>Pro tip: these are covers only, no inserts. If you need inserts, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DFDS56B?tag=dailydealdarl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored">Storage Organizer Bins</a></strong> can help you stay organized while you're refreshing your space, and honestly, I buy my pillow inserts from Amazon for like $8-$12 each and they work perfectly.</p>
<div style="background:#f0f4f8;padding:24px;border-radius:12px;margin:32px 0;text-align:center;"><h3 style="margin:0 0 8px">FREE Weekly Deals Digest</h3><p style="margin:0 0 16px;color:#555">Join our community for weekly tips and guides.</p><script src="https://f.convertkit.com/ckjs/ck.5.js"></script><form action="https://app.convertkit.com/forms/5641382/subscriptions" method="post" data-sv-form="5641382"><input type="email" name="email_address" placeholder="Enter your email" required style="padding:12px;border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:6px;width:60%;margin-right:8px"><button type="submit" style="padding:12px 24px;background:#E91E63;color:#fff;border:none;border-radius:6px;cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold">Join Free</button></form></div>
<h2>Mix & Match Dinner Plates at 50% Off (This Is How You Upgrade Your Table)</h2>
<p>Here's something I learned from my friend who's a food stylist: you don't need matching dish sets. In fact, your table looks way more interesting when you mix different patterns and colors.</p>
<p>Crate & Barrel's individual dinner plates are 50% off right now, which means you can create your own custom set for way less than buying a full matching set. The stoneware dinner plates that were $12.95 each are now $6.47. The porcelain ones are down to $7.50-$9.</p>
<p>I'm personally mixing the white Aspen plates with the speckled reactive glaze ones in that pretty sage green. Total for 8 plates: under $65. A full 8-piece place setting from Crate & Barrel normally runs $150-$200.</p>
<p>The quality on these is solid. They're microwave and dishwasher safe, which is non-negotiable for me because I'm not hand-washing dishes in 2026. They're also the right weight—not so heavy you feel like you're lifting weights at dinner, but substantial enough that they don't feel cheap.</p>
<p>If you're looking to complete your kitchen refresh, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TLZXRK2?tag=dailydealdarl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored">Knife Set Kitchen</a></strong> options are having some great sales right now too, and a good knife set really does make cooking so much easier.</p>
<h2>Accent Mirrors for $39 (CB2 Wants $89 for Similar)</h2>
<p>The round brass-rimmed mirrors in the clearance section are $39.95, down from $79.95. I literally saw almost the exact same mirror at CB2 last week for $89, and the quality looked identical.</p>
<p>These are the 24" round ones, which is the perfect size for an entryway, above a console table, or even in a small bathroom. The brass finish is that brushed antique look, not super shiny, which means it'll actually look good in a few years instead of dated.</p>
<p>The glass is actual glass (not acrylic), so it won't get that cloudy scratched look over time. It's also got proper D-ring hanging hardware, not those flimsy sawtooth hangers that always end up crooked.</p>
<p>Only downside: these are final sale in most stores, so if you're ordering online, make sure you're okay with the size. 24" sounds bigger than it actually is when you get it on your wall. I recommend measuring your space first.</p>
<h2>Bar Carts Are 60% Off (But Only Chrome Finish Left)</h2>
<p>The Pilsen bar cart in chrome is $119, down from $299. That's a genuinely good deal for a bar cart that's not going to fall apart in six months.</p>
<p>Full transparency: the gold and matte black finishes are sold out, which is probably why these are so heavily discounted. Chrome isn't as trendy right now, but here's my take—chrome is a classic finish that never fully goes out of style. It's also easier to clean than matte black (shows every fingerprint) and more versatile than gold (which can clash with other metals in your space).</p>
<p>The cart itself is really well-made. Tempered glass shelves, proper caster wheels that actually roll smoothly, and the frame is solid steel, not hollow tubing. I've had mine for three years and it still looks brand new.</p>
<p>I'm using mine as a coffee station in my kitchen (not a bar situation), and it works perfectly. The top shelf has my coffee maker and mugs, the bottom has my <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078RFVKNR?tag=dailydealdarl-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored">Meal Prep Containers</a></strong> which I use for storing coffee beans and tea bags—keeps everything organized and accessible.</p>
<p>These carts also make excellent gift ideas for women who are moving into new places or renovating. Way more useful than another scented candle.</p>
<h2>What I'm Skipping</h2>
<p>The bedding in the clearance section looks tempting with those discounts, but the sizing is weird—mostly European sizes or odd dimensions. Unless you're specifically looking for a Euro sham or a king duvet cover, it's not worth the hassle.</p>
<p>The rugs are also pretty picked over. Lots of 2x3 sizes left, which are basically only good for in front of your sink or by your bed. Not enough coverage for actual room-defining placement.</p>
<h2>Here's What I'd Do</h2>
<p>If you're trying to refresh your space on a budget, start with the curtains and pillows. Those two things make the biggest visual impact for the least amount of money. Add the dinner plates if you're ready to upgrade from your college dishes (no judgment, I just did this last year).</p>
<p>The mirrors and bar carts are bigger purchases, so think about where you'd actually use them before buying. They're great deals, but only if you need them.</p>
<p>Most of this clearance stuff is selling fast, especially the neutral colors and popular finishes. I'm not trying to create fake urgency—I'm just being real about what I've noticed checking back over the past few days. Things are going out of stock.</p>
<p>And if you miss this sale? Honestly, Crate & Barrel does clearance events pretty regularly. Sign up for their email list (I know, more emails, but this one's actually worth it) and you'll catch the next one. These best home finds come around again, just maybe not in the exact same styles.</p>
<p>Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go justify to my husband why we "need" three new velvet pillows when we already have seven. Wish me luck.</p>
