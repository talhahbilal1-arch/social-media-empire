If you're still using bar soap or a foaming cleanser that leaves your skin feeling tight, it's time for an upgrade. After 30, your skin produces less oil naturally, so harsh cleansers strip away moisture you actually need.\n\nLook for a gentle, pH-balanced cleanser — cream or gel formulas work best. Ingredients like glycerin and ceramides help maintain your skin's moisture barrier while still removing dirt, makeup, and sunscreen. Wash twice daily: once in the morning to remove overnight buildup and once at night to clear the day away.\n\nPro tip: use lukewarm water, not hot. Hot water can irritate and dry out your skin faster than you'd think.",

Let it absorb for about a minute before layering anything on top.

Mineral sunscreens with zinc oxide sit on top of your skin and reflect UV rays, while chemical sunscreens absorb them. Both work well — it's about what feels best on your skin and what you'll actually use daily.\n\nApply a nickel-sized amount to your face and neck every morning as the last step in your skincare routine, before makeup. Reapply every 2 hours if you're outdoors. This one habit will do more for your skin than any expensive cream.",

AHAs like glycolic acid work on the surface for brightening, while BHAs like salicylic acid penetrate pores for acne-prone skin. Start with a low percentage (5-8% glycolic) and use it 2-3 times per week at night.\n\nSkip exfoliating on the same nights you use retinol to avoid irritation.

Gradually increase to every other night, then nightly as your skin tolerates it. Apply a pea-sized amount to dry skin after cleansing but before moisturizer.\n\nExpect some initial dryness and mild peeling — that's normal and usually subsides within 2-4 weeks.
