## Email 4: The Story Behind Daily Deal Darling
**Send**: Day 6
**Subject Line**: Why I started this (personal story)

### Content:
```
Hey {first_name}!

I realized I never actually told you WHY I started Daily Deal Darling...

[Personal story about discovering deals/being budget-conscious]

That experience taught me that you don't have to spend a fortune to have nice things. And now I'm on a mission to help YOU find those hidden gems too.

Every deal I share is something I've personally tested (or my friends and family have tested and loved).

Your trust means everything to me, and I never recommend something I wouldn't use myself.

Thanks for being here. 💕
