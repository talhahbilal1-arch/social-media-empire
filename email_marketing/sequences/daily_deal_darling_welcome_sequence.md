## Email 4: The Story + Trust Building
**Send**: Day 6
**Subject Line**: The embarrassing story of how this started...
**Preview Text**: I spent $400 on products that didn't work

### Content:
```
Hey {first_name}!

I've been sending you deals but I realized I never told you WHY I started Daily Deal Darling...

**The embarrassing truth:**

A few years ago, I got sucked into TikTok shopping. You know how it goes - someone says "OMG this changed my life!" and suddenly you're clicking "buy now" at 2am.

I spent over $400 on products that month.

And you know what? Most of them were GARBAGE. 😭

The "life-changing" mascara clumped. The "viral" gadget broke after a week. The "must-have" skincare burned my face.

I was SO frustrated.

That's when I decided: someone needs to actually TEST these things before recommending them.

So I started:
- Buying products with my own money
- Testing them for weeks (not just one use)
- Only sharing things that ACTUALLY work
- Being honest about the cons too

Now I have a simple rule: **If I wouldn't buy it twice, I don't recommend it.**

That's why your trust means everything to me. I know you're spending your hard-earned money on my suggestions.

I take that seriously. 💕

Thank you for being here and for trusting me with your shopping list!
