        Build your base with compound movements, proper form, and progressive overload. This phase focuses on re-establishing movement patterns and building the habit of consistent training.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 8px;"><strong>Phase 2: Strength Building (Weeks 5-8)</strong><br>
        Increase intensity with structured strength work. You will train 3-4 days per week with proven exercises that build functional muscle while protecting your joints.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Phase 3: Performance (Weeks 9-12)</strong><br>
        Push your limits with advanced programming. This is where the transformation happens -- increased strength, better body composition, and the confidence that comes with consistent progress.</p>
