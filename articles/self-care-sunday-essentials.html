            <h1>Self-Care Sunday Essentials</h1>
            <p class="date">Published: January 2026</p>

            <p>Self-care isn't selfish - it's essential. Taking time to recharge isn't just about bubble baths and face masks (though we love those too!). It's about creating rituals that help you feel your best. Here are our favorite products for the ultimate self-care Sunday that will leave you refreshed and ready to tackle the week ahead.</p>

            <h2>1. Best Muscle Recovery: Theragun Mini</h2>
            <p>Tension headaches, sore muscles, tight shoulders from sitting at a desk all week - the Theragun Mini tackles them all. This portable massage gun delivers professional-quality percussive therapy in a device that fits in your purse.</p>
            <p>Despite its small size, it's surprisingly powerful with three speed settings. Use it on your neck, back, legs, or feet for instant relief. It's also whisper-quiet, so you can use it while watching your favorite show.</p>

            <h2>2. Best Overnight Treatment: Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask</h2>
            <p>This cult-favorite lip mask has achieved legendary status for good reason. Apply it before bed, and wake up to the softest, most hydrated lips of your life. The berry scent is divine without being overwhelming.</p>
            <p>A little goes a long way - one jar can last 6+ months with nightly use. It's also great as a daytime lip treatment when your lips need extra TLC. Trust us, once you try it, you'll understand the hype.</p>

            <h2>3. Best Reading Experience: Kindle Paperwhite</h2>
            <p>Self-care includes feeding your mind. The Kindle Paperwhite makes reading pure pleasure with its glare-free display, adjustable warm light, and waterproof design (yes, you can read in the bath!).</p>
            <p>One charge lasts up to 10 weeks, and you can carry thousands of books in something lighter than a paperback. The adjustable warm light is perfect for reading before bed without disrupting your sleep.</p>

            <h2>4. Best Sleep Aid: Premium Weighted Blanket</h2>
            <p>Weighted blankets use deep pressure stimulation to help reduce anxiety and promote better sleep. It's like getting a warm hug all night long. Choose a blanket that's about 10% of your body weight for optimal comfort.</p>
            <p>This premium blanket features a breathable cotton cover and evenly distributed glass beads for consistent weight. It's perfect for movie nights, reading sessions, or whenever you need a little extra comfort.</p>

            <h2>5. Best Aromatherapy: Essential Oil Diffuser</h2>
            <p>Transform any room into a spa with this elegant essential oil diffuser. Add a few drops of lavender for relaxation, peppermint for energy, or eucalyptus for clarity. The soft glow also works as a gentle night light.</p>
            <p>This diffuser runs silently, has multiple mist settings, and automatically shuts off when the water runs out. Pair it with your favorite essential oils for a complete aromatherapy experience.</p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>The best self-care routine is one you'll actually do. You don't need to block out hours or spend hundreds of dollars. Even 15 minutes with a good book and a face mask can make a difference in how you feel.</p>
            <p>Start small, be consistent, and remember that taking care of yourself enables you to take better care of everyone else in your life. You deserve it!</p>
