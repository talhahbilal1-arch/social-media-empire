## Example Script: Zinc & Testosterone

**Title**: Stop Taking Zinc for Testosterone

**Script**:
```
Stop taking zinc for testosterone unless you're actually deficient.

A 2023 study found that zinc supplementation only raised testosterone in men who were low to begin with.

If your zinc levels are normal, you're wasting your money.

Here's what to do instead:

First, get a blood test. Check your zinc AND testosterone levels.

Second, if you're deficient, 15-30mg daily is enough. More isn't better.

Third, focus on what actually works: sleep, strength training, and managing stress.

Follow for more evidence-based fitness tips.
