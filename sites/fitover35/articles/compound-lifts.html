    <article class="article-content">
        <p>If you're a man over 35 looking to build real, functional strength while maximizing your time in the gym, compound lifts are your best friend. These multi-joint movements recruit multiple muscle groups simultaneously, making them incredibly efficient for building muscle, burning fat, and boosting testosterone.</p>

        <p>Unlike isolation exercises that target single muscles, compound movements mirror real-world activities and build the kind of practical strength you need as you age. Here are the five essential compound lifts every man should master.</p>

        <h2>1. The Squat - King of All Exercises</h2>

        <div class="exercise-card">
            <h3>Muscles Worked</h3>
            <p>Quadriceps, glutes, hamstrings, core, lower back</p>

            <h3>Why It Matters After 35</h3>
            <p>The squat builds the leg strength essential for maintaining mobility and independence as you age. It also triggers significant testosterone and growth hormone release.</p>

            <h3>Key Form Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep your chest up and core braced throughout the movement</li>
                <li>Push your knees out in line with your toes</li>
                <li>Go as deep as your mobility allows while maintaining a neutral spine</li>
                <li>Drive through your heels on the way up</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If mobility is an issue, start with goblet squats. Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell at your chest - this helps counterbalance and allows you to squat deeper with better form.
        </div>

        <h2>2. The Deadlift - Total Body Power</h2>

        <div class="exercise-card">
            <h3>Muscles Worked</h3>
            <p>Entire posterior chain: hamstrings, glutes, lower back, upper back, traps, forearms</p>

            <h3>Why It Matters After 35</h3>
            <p>The deadlift strengthens your entire back side, which is crucial for posture and preventing the back pain that plagues many men in their 40s and beyond.</p>

            <h3>Key Form Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with the bar over mid-foot, shins nearly touching</li>
                <li>Keep your back flat - never round your lower back</li>
                <li>Push the floor away rather than pulling the bar up</li>
                <li>Keep the bar close to your body throughout</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>3. The Bench Press - Upper Body Foundation</h2>

        <div class="exercise-card">
            <h3>Muscles Worked</h3>
            <p>Chest, front deltoids, triceps</p>

            <h3>Why It Matters After 35</h3>
            <p>Beyond building an impressive chest, the bench press maintains pushing strength essential for daily activities and sports.</p>

            <h3>Key Form Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Retract your shoulder blades and create an arch in your upper back</li>
                <li>Lower the bar to your lower chest/nipple line</li>
                <li>Keep your feet flat on the floor and drive through them</li>
                <li>Don't bounce the bar off your chest</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>4. The Overhead Press - Shoulder Strength & Stability</h2>

        <div class="exercise-card">
            <h3>Muscles Worked</h3>
            <p>Shoulders, triceps, upper chest, core</p>

            <h3>Why It Matters After 35</h3>
            <p>Shoulder injuries become more common as we age. The overhead press builds the strength and stability to protect these vulnerable joints.</p>

            <h3>Key Form Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with the bar at shoulder height, elbows slightly in front</li>
                <li>Brace your core and squeeze your glutes</li>
                <li>Press straight up, moving your head back slightly to clear the bar</li>
                <li>Lock out fully at the top</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>5. The Barbell Row - Back Builder</h2>

        <div class="exercise-card">
            <h3>Muscles Worked</h3>
            <p>Lats, rhomboids, rear deltoids, biceps, lower back</p>

            <h3>Why It Matters After 35</h3>
            <p>Counteracts the forward-hunched posture from desk work. A strong back is essential for a healthy spine and athletic performance.</p>

            <h3>Key Form Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hinge at the hips with a slight knee bend</li>
                <li>Keep your back flat and core engaged</li>
                <li>Pull to your lower chest/upper stomach</li>
                <li>Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Programming These Lifts</h2>

        <p>For men over 35, I recommend the following approach:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Hit each lift 2x per week for optimal muscle protein synthesis</li>
            <li><strong>Sets/Reps:</strong> 3-4 sets of 6-8 reps for strength, 3 sets of 8-12 for hypertrophy</li>
            <li><strong>Rest:</strong> Take 2-3 minutes between heavy sets - recovery matters more as we age</li>
            <li><strong>Progression:</strong> Add weight only when you can complete all reps with perfect form</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Recovery Note:</strong> At 35+, your recovery ability isn't what it was at 25. Listen to your body, prioritize sleep, and don't be afraid to take an extra rest day when needed.
        </div>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

        <p>Mastering these five compound lifts will give you 80% of the results you're looking for. They're efficient, effective, and build the kind of functional strength that translates to real life.</p>

        <p>Start with lighter weights and focus on perfecting your form. As a man over 35, the name of the game is longevity - we're building a body that will serve us for decades, not just look good for summer.</p>
