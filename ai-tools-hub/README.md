# ToolPilot - AI Tools Directory & Comparison Site

**Live URL**: https://ai-tools-hub-lilac.vercel.app
**Revenue Model**: AI SaaS affiliate commissions (25-50% recurring)

## Executive Summary

ToolPilot is an SEO-optimized AI tools comparison directory that earns recurring affiliate commissions from AI SaaS products. The site helps users find and compare AI tools across 10 categories, driving revenue through affiliate links on tool review pages, comparison pages, and "try it free" CTAs.

### Why This Will Make Money

1. **AI SaaS affiliate commissions are recurring** - Unlike one-time product affiliates, AI tool subscriptions pay 25-50% monthly for the lifetime of the customer
2. **Growing market** - The AI tools market is projected to reach $1.3T by 2032, with search demand increasing monthly
3. **Long-tail SEO** - Keywords like "ChatGPT vs Claude", "best AI writing tool", "Jasper review 2026" have high buyer intent
4. **Zero operating cost** - Static site hosted free on Netlify, content generated by AI

### Revenue Projections

| Period | Traffic (monthly) | Click-through Rate | Conversion Rate | Avg Commission | Revenue |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|---------|
| Week 1-4 | 100-500 | 5% | 2% | $15/mo | $2-8/mo |
| Month 2-3 | 500-2,000 | 5% | 3% | $15/mo | $8-45/mo |
| Month 4-6 | 2,000-10,000 | 6% | 3% | $15/mo | $54-270/mo |
| Month 7-12 | 10,000-50,000 | 7% | 3% | $15/mo | $315-1,575/mo |

*Recurring commissions compound - early conversions continue paying monthly*
